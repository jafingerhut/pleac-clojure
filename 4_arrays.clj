;; Clojure is often written in a functional style, meaning that you
;; calculate output value from input values.  So Clojure's 'for' is
;; actually a way to take one or more input sequences and produce an
;; output sequence, and in fact this is done in a lazy fashion,
;; meaning that no actual computation occurs unless some other code
;; _uses_ elements of the output sequence.

;; If you use Clojure's REPL to try out code before using it in a
;; program, this can easily confuse you, because at the REPL, every
;; expression you enter is read, executed, and the result is printed.
;; The fact that the result is printed often forces lazy expressions
;; to calculate their entire result, but if you use that lazy
;; expression as part of a larger expression or program, it won't be.

;; Here are a couple of quick examples:

user=> (range 0 5)
(0 1 2 3 4)

;; i iterates over the elements of the sequence (range 0 5).  The for
;; expression as a whole returns a sequence containing (inc i) for
;; each input sequence element.  It does this lazily, but because we
;; are typing it at the REPL, the output value is used in order to
;; print it.
user=> (for [i (range 0 5)] (inc i))
(1 2 3 4 5)

;; Here we add some debug print statements, and its output gets
;; mingled with the printed output value.
user=> (for [i (range 0 5)] (do (printf "i=%d\n" i) (inc i)))
(i=0
i=1
i=2
i=3
i=4
1 2 3 4 5)
;; Here we assign the value of the for expression to a var.  Note that
;; the only output printed is the output value of the def statement,
;; which is #'user/a1.  Why don't the printf's get executed?  Because
;; the for is lazy, and nothing has used any part of its output value
;; yet.
user=> (def a1 (for [i (range 0 5)] (do (printf "i=%d\n" i) (inc i))))
#'user/a1

;; When we ask for the value of a1, then the output value of the for
;; expression is required, and so its body is executed now.
user=> a1
(i=0
i=1
i=2
i=3
i=4
1 2 3 4 5)

;; If you want to force the iteration to occur when it is evaluated,
;; use doseq instead.  It does not return any useful value (only nil),
;; and is intended to be used when the body contains side effects.
;; Here the (inc i) is superfluous, since it simply returns a value

;; Because Clojure doesn't provide a way to modify its collections in

;; iterate over several different collections in a single loop.

;; clojure.string/trim returns a string the same as the string you
;; give it, except with white space at the beginning and end removed.

;; do-to-map was written by Brian Carper, and he also wrote the
;; explanation for how it works that I have copied below.  Original
;; source is at the following URL:

;; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1638854/clojure-how-do-i-apply-a-function-to-a-subset-of-the-entries-in-a-hash-map

;; It helps to look at it inside-out.  In Clojure, hash-maps act like
;; functions; if you call them like a function with a key as an
;; argument, the value associated with that key is returned.  So given
;; a single key, the current value for that key can be obtained via:

;; (some-map some-key)

;; We want to take old values, and change them to new values by
;; calling some function f on them.  So given a single key, the new
;; value will be:

;; (f (some-map some-key))

;; We want to associate this new value with this key in our hash-map,
;; "replacing" the old value.  This is what assoc does:

;; (assoc some-map some-key (f (some-map some-key)))

;; ("Replace" is in scare-quotes because we're not mutating a single
;; hash-map object; we're returning new, immutable, altered hash-map
;; objects each time we call assoc.  This is still fast and efficient
;; in Clojure because hash-maps are persistent and share structure
;; when you assoc them.)

;; We need to repeatedly assoc new values onto our map, one key at a
;; time.  So we need some kind of looping construct.  What we want is
;; to start with our original hash-map and a single key, and then
;; "update" the value for that key.  Then we take that new hash-map
;; and the next key, and "update" the value for that next key.  And we
;; repeat this for every key, one at a time, and finally return the
;; hash-map we've "accumulated".  This is what reduce does.

;; * The first argument to reduce is a function that takes two
;;   arguments: an "accumulator" value, which is the value we keep
;;   "updating" over and over; and a single argument used in one
;;   iteration to do some of the accumulating.
;; * The second argument to reduce is the initial value passed as the
;;   first argument to this fn.
;; * The third argument to reduce is a collection of arguments to be
;;   passed as the second argument to this fn, one at a time.

;; So:

;; (reduce fn-to-update-values-in-our-map 
;;         initial-value-of-our-map 
;;         collection-of-keys)

;; fn-to-update-values-in-our-map is just the assoc statement from
;; above, wrapped in an anonymous function:

;; (fn [map-so-far some-key]
;;   (assoc map-so-far some-key (f (map-so-far some-key))))

;; So plugging it into reduce:

;; (reduce (fn [map-so-far some-key]
;;           (assoc map-so-far some-key (f (map-so-far some-key))))
;;         amap
;;         keyseq)

;; In Clojure, there's a shorthand for writing anonymous functions:
;; #(...) is an anonymous fn consisting of a single form, in which %1
;; is bound to the first argument to the anonymous function, %2 to the
;; second, etc.  So our fn from above can be written equivalently as:

;; #(assoc %1 %2 (f (%1 %2)))

;; This gives us:

;; (reduce #(assoc %1 %2 (f (%1 %2))) amap keyseq)

(defn do-to-map [amap keyseq f]

;; Clojure sets above does not.
;;
;; To see this behavior, try out the code below with these values for
;; a and b:
;;
;; (def a [1 3 5 6 7 8])
;; (def b [2 3 5 7 9 2])  ; 2 is duplicated, and will appear in isect

;; clunky.  However, if you really want to write something in

;; The example using set/union and set/difference is really the best
;; way to go in Clojure, though.
;;-----------------------------

(let [set-a (set a)
      set-b (set b)
      union (set/union set-a set-b)
      isect (set/intersection set-a set-b)

      ;; Or, if you want to find the 'symmetric difference' without
      ;; explicitly calculation the union and intersection first,
      ;; another way is:
      ;; diff (set/union (set/difference set-a set-b)
      ;;                 (set/difference set-b set-a))
      ]
  (printf "union=%s\n" (str/join " " union))
  (printf "isect=%s\n" (str/join " " isect))
  (printf "diff=%s\n" (str/join " " diff)))
union=1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
isect=3 5 7
diff=1 2 6 8 9

;; Next a way closer to the Perl code, but without with-local-vars.
;; Function tally copied from an earlier example, repeated for easier
;; reference.

  (reduce #(assoc %1 %2 ((fnil inc 0) (%1 %2)))
